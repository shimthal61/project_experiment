"2",2,"Paying attention to Y axis and comparing values to actual sample size."
"3",3,"I tried to put a lot of attention on the data written on the sides of the bar charts, since it varied a lot in between questions. I think it would be a good idea to put some kind of highlight on important data on the questions, as it would make them easier to read."
"4",5,"checking what numbers are presented on the graphs and comparing with numbers giving in the task description"
"5",6,"Divide the number questioned by the answer to find the average"
"6",7,"I checked how many people took part in the survey and compared them with the answers"
"7",9,"I didn't had any strategies"
"8",10,"Divide the line below in my head depending the maximum participants and place the marker close to the group average."
"9",11,"I looked at mean of every group and compared it to number of people."
"10",12,"I based my choices on the numbers written on the chart"
"11",13,"the scale did not match everytime with the total number o participants"
"12",14,"Not something specific just try to be correct"
"13",15,"There wasn't really a strategy. If for example 100 people did something and 28 were successful on that, I'd slide the bar close to 1/4"
"14",16,"I think about how much the percentage is all about, i.e. ""30%""."
"15",17,"No strategy, just common sense. The more the people or the questions had positive answers, the better my evaluation would be."
"16",18,"I use the 50% or the middle of the bar as reference, and I used the scale and the size of the bars"
"17",21,"-"
"18",22,"I was looking how many people has taken part in questionnaire and looking on the chart"
"19",23,"I used basic math skills to determine what quantity I was asked to mark and went on from there"
"20",24,"I mainly used fractions using the maximum number and the medium number"
"21",25,"I tried to replicate the number of success cases / by the possible cases in the taskbar"
"22",28,"i double checked the number of people. i dont know if i did this write but if it said 400 people were tested and the bar chart only went up to 100 then i scored it low, i read it as carefully as i could"
"23",31,"My strategy was to read everything and after that judge where to click"
"24",32,"I focused on the numbers in the text and then compared them on a bar graph. Also I tried to split the line in half and another half to decide is it more or less than a half. The study for me was tiring for my eyes, cause of monotonous gray background and bright font."
"25",33,"I just tried to read carefully and use logic"
"26",34,"I just tried to pay attention to the graphs and started at 50% on the bar."
"27",35,"I was checking the graphs carefully, because sometimes they did not present all the date on the left side. In my head, I was separating the chart bars into parts, so I would give the best answer I could."
"28",36,"I tried to chop the scale bar to smaller pieces and I tried to convert numbers to percentages."
"29",37,"Just reading and thinking."
"30",38,"No strategy really, i was just doing my best to read the stats presented by the graph"
"31",39,"I worked out the percentage that the bar chart represented and then tried to position the marker in the place on the line that best matched the original percentage"
"32",40,"I checked the total and the samples each column had. If it were a big difference between the total and the samples the scale was poor, but if it was a small difference, the scale was rich."
"33",41,"No especific strategy other than interpreting the charts correctly and trying to hit the right bar spot."
"34",42,"To try and put the slider in the best position, I would start by putting it in the middle. Then it was easier to know where would be, for example, 1/5 or 1/4 of the users"
"35",43,"I tried to find the middle of the bar and started from that."
"36",46,"Looked at the info, then the structure of the graph to decide on the answer."
"37",47,"i tried to use fractions and percentages to try and guess as accurately as possible"
"38",48,"I tried to analyze the given data and the range from the charts"
"39",49,"I first moved the triangle to the middle of the line."
"40",50,"Looked at the numbers and height of the graphs"
"41",51,"just read the info and answered. No kind of strategy involved,just tried my best approximation."
"42",52,"I tried to visualise a 50% mark on the line, then a 25% mark on the line to help with a close to 25% graph result. Or divide the line into six sectors if say the graph represented around 100 out of 600 were successful."
"43",53,"I didn't use any strategies."
"44",54,"none"
"45",55,"I always looked for total number of participants nad tried to find mean value on chart"
"46",56,"I have taken the right end of the bar as the number of test/data performed (detailed in text) and then understading that if the graph showed a lower figure where would I place it if I understand that the middle of the bar would be the half of test/data and the left end equal a 0"
"47",58,"No, I read the question and analysed the data to the best of my ability."
"48",59,"I didn't think I used any strategie."
"49",65,"I attempted using ratios of the total number given compared to the heights of the data given in the bar chart"
"50",66,"No particular strategy, I enjoyed the study very much."
"51",67,"Finding the mid point of all people asked. If 400, then 200, so if average on graph is 150 then I'd estimate the point to be slightly less than half."
"52",68,"Look at the number of participants and not just looking at the size of the bars"
"53",69,"I first tried to figure out the percentage that I needed. Then I would estimate on the graph, where that percentage was likely to be situated. After that, it was pretty much a guess to get the marker correct"
"54",70,"The strategy I used during the experiment was taking a closer look to the graphs presented and in particular if these were high or low. Of course the important thing was to read carefully the context of each survey."
"55",71,"I divided the bar in parts corresponding to the total amount of people tested, usually by 100, and then picked my results from there, based on the graphs results"
"56",73,"Estimation of the average value of the variable and division of the sliding scale into adeuate parts, according to need."
"57",74,"take a look only at the bullet points. Total number of participants, the meaning of each axis on the graph, and detecting if a high number meant a good thing or a bad thing"
"58",75,"i tried to proportionally divide the line and represent in it the mean frequency (i.e, if the universe was of 600, and the frequency 300, i would put the arrow mark in the middle)"
"59",76,"Scale on the side along with the total number of people polled/surveyed, and judged the fraction or ratio from it"
"60",78,"Reading the total number of participants, and then looking for the average trendline of the bar chart."
"61",79,"None"
"62",81,"based on the number of bars near top or bottom was how calculated the answer"
"63",82,"I kept the target number in mind when making my assessments."
"64",83,"I looked at the graphs and generally the data and patterns. Additionally, I looked at the Y axis measurements in comparison to the detailed explanation."
"65",84,"I used putting the numbers into fractions and then putting the fraction into a percent and clicking in that spot."
"66",85,"none"
"67",86,"Nothing"
"68",87,"Tried to work out a percentage and then convert it to the bottom line"
"69",88,"Mostly focused on making sure the y axis was to the scale of the surveyed population."
"70",89,"The scale I used one end as 0 and the other end as the number of people surveyed and placed my marker at my estimate of percentage of the answer."
"71",90,"I did not use anything specific"
"72",91,"I went by the total numbers that were polled and the numbers of the responses."
"73",92,"I tried to imagine the scale on the side having more numbers to align with the bars."
"74",93,"I read the description and gave a quick estimate"
"75",94,"I interpreted the information on the graphs, as it seemed to me."
"76",95,"I tried to come up with fractions for the informaition presented. I felt like if the bar graph topped out at 200 and there were 600 people surveyed then about 1/3 would agree if it went almost to the top."
"77",96,"I read the study description, then the question being asked, then I looked for the maximum value in the graphics and mentally divided that by the number of participants, and with the percentage value I marked the estimative in the marker."
"78",98,"I mainly thought about the overall sample size and then compared it to the graph data. Also thought about the scenario given."
"79",99,"read the instructions and pick high on the scale if the results showed high on the graph"
"80",101,"I looked at the numbers shown on the charts as well as the total amount that was actually surveyed/analysed for example to figure out the answer. I think the study seems interesting."
"81",102,"Just used the data and tried to match it with the slider."
"82",103,"I just paid close attention to the scales and answered accordingly. Hope you have a successful study!"
"83",105,"see the total the sample was, then see the scale on the graph. and take that into account. so if there 150 and the sample is 600 the graph continue up enough 450."
"84",106,"Strategies? I tried to use common sense!"
"85",107,"I based my answers depending on the amount of people that participated in each ""study"" and using the graphs to see the results. For example, if 500 people participated and the graph showed that 250 were satisfied then I would put the marker in the middle of the line."
"86",108,"I observed the total on the graph and the description presented. No additional comment needed."
"87",110,"Looking at the total and then get 50% from that. Looking at the graph and see how far above or below it was from that. 
I saw the scaling bar as 100% and divided the results of the study to % to place the slider"
"88",111,"No explicit strategy"
"89",112,"I tried to gauge how high the scale was in each graph, as the numbers often didn't represent 100% of the survey amount."
"90",113,"I would look at the total number of participants, and compare that to the number indicated on the graph. Often the scale was off, like there were 600 participants, but the scale only went up to 125. So 125 of 600 is only slightly better than 1/6th, so I would try to indicate that on the scale."
"91",114,"Read the numbers stated as the graph didn't always show the max number."
"92",116,"I considered the total number of participants and then looked to the graph for how many of those participants were applicable to the scenario."
"93",117,"I worked them out as rough percentages and tried to put them as close on the line graph as possible. With hatch marks at 25 50 and 75 percent on the line graph I probably could have been more accurate as it is more difficult for me to ascertain where on the line graph a number is without a reference. Putting the mark at half or a quarter and adjusting from there got me as close as I could get."
"94",118,"I used a percentage scale based on the graph bars and the number of people, etc presented in the graph bars to determine my answer. Thank you!"
"95",119,"I didn't use any particular strategies
"
"96",120,"I looked at bar after reading description and estimated placement."
"97",121,"I would read the number in the description, then check the intervals on the y-axis to see how they represented the data. I made all my judgments based on those two numbers. I would also double-check what the graph was representing at times."
"98",123,"divided line into 5ths, 4ths, depending on question before selecting where marker went."
"99",124,"At first I was unaware of the vertical (y) axis, and just paid attention to the size of the bars. Then I paid attention to all the data and compared both the presented description and the data presented in the chart. I realised sometimes the data in the chart was not matching the data presented in the description."
"100",125,"I paid attention to how high the bars were which would indicate a greater number"
"101",126,"Verify, that the total amount stated in the description was equal to the total amount on the graph, and if not re-adjust the percentage, to what was stated."
"102",127,"I first moved the bar to the center at 50%. Then I moved to 25%. Then I moved to a half of that and so on."
"103",128,"My judgement was largely influenced by the proportion of the numbers moreso than the proportion of the graphics (I imagine your study is using as a criterion variable the extent to which people are biased by the graphic representation of the data). Just bear in mind that there are times when just because on average, say, 40% of cases ""pass"" I don't necessarily consider some intervention ""40%"" effective per se. I'm a bit drowsy at the moment, but if you're curious what I mean, you can feel free to contact me again via Prolific and I'll elaborate (I may need a reminder w.r.t. the stimuli/wording, though)."
"104",129,"I looked at the graph and at the results of the graph. I then determined how close to the middle point the answer was from there. Then when I moved to the middle point, I moved to the next mid point from there and used that as a reference point. For example, if the sample was out of 400 and the samples hovered around 125, I would first move to 200 (the middle) and then the middle of that (100) then move to the right a bit for 125. For the first one where the total number wasn't shown on the chart (total out of 600 but chart numbers only go up to 125 for example) I was confused as to whether that was a typo or not. So for that particular one, I assumed there was an error in the question and just looked at the bar charts in relation to the chart. The next time it happened, I realized I was wrong. So that first one I goofed. But the rest I did the correct way."
"105",130,"Tried to work out a rough percentage and transfer that to the marker"
"106",131,"I tried to create a mental scale based on the specifics."
"107",132,"I quickly realized that the numbers often were higher than the ranges expressed in the charts. I calculated percentages in my head and tried to approximate where they would fall, by measuring approximate distances with my fingers. Like for 100 / 600 I would measure a halfway point, then imagine it in thirds. I enjoyed this very much! Thanks"
"108",134,"I did not use any particular strategy"
"109",135,"I made sure to check the scale of the bars and numbers on the y-axis relative to the number number of subjects."
"110",137,"I did not use any strategies, and I do not have any comments about the study."
"111",138,"No strategies. There were too many attention checks. It distracted from the point of the experiment."
"112",139,"Always keep in mind the total number of subjects tested and discover the number at the middle of the slider. Then make my choice from there, if the average number was in the first half or the second half of the slider."
"113",140,"I just tried to answer the questions based on the information given and the information from the graphs"
"114",141,"I visually measured and estimated the results in relation to the response bar"
"115",142,"It took me a while to realize that not all the data in the story was being represented on the graph. Once I figured that out, I believe I started doing a bit better. But I really did struggle with these concepts."
"116",143,"I use a ruler to measure the line to get a better result"
"117",144,"I tried to split the bar with my fingers in equal parts and determine where I had to put the arrow on the scale.

Thanks!"
"118",145,"Looking at the y axis and comparing those numbers with the ones in the description of the study."
"119",147,"Pay attention to the scale of the chart and try to divide the bar by, for example, 5 if it were 500 people surveyed, to accurately place the marker."
"120",150,"I didn't have a strategy per se. I just read the bar charts. I did think some of them were a little tricky to answer without additional information. For example, it's hard to determine the success of an allergy medication without knowing what the normal rate of success and failure is with a new product. There was a question about how many people left positive feedback about a course, but it didn't include any info about how many people left negative feedback, so it was hard to determine how happy/unhappy they were. There were questions about the performance of people in tests (I think one was about psychology). Again, I found it hard to rate their performance without knowing how difficult the test was. Although their scores were poor, it might have been an incredibly hard test, in which case their results might have actually been good. There was also a question about online yoga classes. The question was about how effective the yoga classes were at improving flexibility whereas the statement was about if people felt more flexible after their class. The question was more fact-based, whereas the statement was more of an opinion. For example, the person in the yoga class might have felt their flexibility hasn't improved, but if it was actually put to the test, they might have found that their flexibility had improved. I know it seems like I'm splitting hairs, but those were some of the thoughts running through my mind when I was trying to give you an accurate rating."
